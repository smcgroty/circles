# circles
 Simple app to draw randomly generated circles

This is a very simple Python and Tk-based app that draws randomly colored and sized circles. 
The image can be saved as an EPS file by double-clicking on the image to launch a file save dialog.
The maximum radius and circle drawing interval can be adjusted with the labeled input fields.

Note: this was quickly written and should not be used as an example of best practices.

Requirements: Python 3 with Tk support and tkinter package installed
